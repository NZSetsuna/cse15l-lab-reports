# Week 1 Lab Report
1. **Installing VScode**\

* I've installed Vscode through the *Visual Studio Code* website [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/) before Lab. I haven't had any issues with the previous installs.

2. **Romtely Connecting**\

* In this step, it took me a while to figure out my own account name. That needs to be checked from the UCSD Account Center. Sadly, I'm struggling with the steps to change the password. I changed my password three times in total and took the entire Lab session to successfully connect to the remote server.

3. **Trying Some Commands**\

* Running commands on a remote computer feels fresh to me. I entered the wrong file address once during my attempt, which resulted in an error. This is what I think needs attention.

4. **Moving Files with scp**\

* I didn't try to run the program locally with Java in this step because I don't have Java installed on my computer. Use the scp command to send the program to the remote server, the process is very similar to the ssh command used for login. 
* Run the Java program on the ieng6 computer, and the environment will completely become the configuration environment of the ieng6 computer.

5. **Setting an SSH Key**\

* I'm having a good time setting up the SSH keys, but I'm completely unable to do the extra steps in a Windows environment. Create an ssh key locally to save the private key and store the public key in the remote server, so that you no longer need to enter a password to access the remote server.This greatly reduces the time it takes for me to access the remote server.

6. **Optimizing Remote Running**\

* Using quotes after the ssh command to run the command directly on the remote server is very convenient.
* I ran it in quotes and semicolons after sending the program to the remote server, and it took only two lines.
